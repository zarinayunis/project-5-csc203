I believe that the functions that performed simple mathematical computations could be reasonably placed in any of the
classes.These functions, like getIntFromRange() tend to actually work better as static methods, in my opinion. Thus, I
would be fine including them anywhere.

In a similar note to the mathematical computations, I think the methods that create entities, like createDudeNotFull()
would work better as static methods, and thus could be placed anywhere. I think it would be more readable in the class
Entity.

scheduleActions() is also one that could reasonably be placed in multiple categories. I believe that it would do just as
well in EventScheduler as it would in the Entity class.

getCurrentImage() could be placed in any class, since it does not reference a specific object. In theory, it could be
placed in Entity or Background, since that is what it specifically references.

load() could be placed in WorldModel, ImageStore, or Background, since it references these specifically. I would actually
think that it would be more readable in ImageStore, since it appears to work directly with images. However, it references
WorldModel's variables so much that it is also more convenient to have it placed in this class.
